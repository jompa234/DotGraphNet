# graph-net

Graph-net is a small and simple library for creating simple graphs.

The api let's you create objects representing graphs, sub-graphs, nodes and edges in code.
Then the graph can be converted into a file written in the dot-language for further processing with the open source graph visualization software Graphviz. 

Written in c# .net standard.
